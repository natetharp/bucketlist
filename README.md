## Notes

-   NFL stadiums from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_National_Football_League_stadiums).

-   MLB team logos from [this website](https://www.sportslogos.net/teams/list_by_year/42022/2022_MLB_Logos/).
-   I'm using [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) for the icons.
-   Using ESModules with a good [intro here](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/super-simple-start-to-es-modules-in-the-browser).
-   Using a [`for...of` loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of).
-   Used the [CSS Shadow Palette Generator](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/shadow-palette/) for the card shadows.
